# PikachuVolleyball
Pikachu Volleyball clone game made by C++ and SDL library.

I found that I can't play the old Pikachu Volleyball game on Mac OS.

So I decided to make on my own!

Moreover, I added networking play feature by using TCP.

There are trivial differences like ball's motion and speed, compared to the original.

Please enjoy it!

## Work in Progress

* Building AI
- currently, AI jumps randomly. Researching how to make a smart AI which predicts the ball and the player's moves and react to those actions...

* Smoothe Ball's motion
- I wanted to make the ball move like the original but failed. Still researching...
